# ðŸŽ® SkillCraft ML Project: Predicting StarCraft Player Skill Levels

This repository contains a full ML pipeline built to predict StarCraft II player skill tiers using gameplay data from the SkillCraft dataset.  
The workflow is modularized into four major Jupyter Notebooks:

| Notebook              | Description                          |
|-----------------------|--------------------------------------|
| TASK01                | Data cleaning, preprocessing, and EDA|
| TASK02                | Feature engineering & selection      |
| TASK03                | Model training (XGBoost, RF, etc.)   |
| TASK04                | Evaluation, visualization, insights  |
